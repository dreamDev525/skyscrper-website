But this is not your average NYC, it is a multiverse version of NYC set back in 1987 filled with anthropomorphic (animals with physical human traits to you and i ) inhabitants and characters. These land plots are the first in-game asset to be sold for Skyscraper and will allow your character and chosen team to expand their territory, develop your land as you see fit and earn the rewards and resources from your hard work.

Depending on what you develop, based on the plot type and its permits and district affluence, will determine your earnings for both you and your team. The land mint will be randomised so you have a good chance of scoring high-value land in high-value districts. This will be a huge win for you and your chosen faction.

Get your roller dex, money clips and brick phone and let's make some money moves. Hopefully, you’ll make it.",

The Entire NYC 5 boroughs have been mapped and divided into purchasable land plots using a complex algorithm that allows us full control over the types of plots present within any one district. We have 25% of our characters developed. We are on our way, however due to market conditions we will probably delay until we have a favourable headwind.

The new team containing new and original core members are here to evolve and learn from any past mistakes. Your WOWS and C-Folios are valuable! We will be providing a 1:1 swap (based on a snapshot), between $WOWS and $TURF with your WOWS being valued at the presale price of $18. You will not lose by holding WOWS. In fact, at current prices, that's an instant 8x gain. Your SFT C-Folios will become powerful genesis characters with unique abilities in Skyscraper. We will provide a swap in order to upgrade the character contracts in due course. We look forward to our next chapter. ",

Ok we did atrophy terribly, the main reason is we were advised incorrectly to only hold a very small microscopic presale for WOWS and grow organically. This meant although we attained the heady heights of $35 millions market cap we had no development budget in Eth. In fact all our value was in $WOWS which we didn’t want to sell so that we didn't affect the price point for our investors. In fact as a team we have only sold about 10% of our vested team tokens and only about 20% of our marketing tokens. So we can with pride say we did our best to protect buyers to our own detriment. The main thing however is we learn and adapt. Our next presale will not be small and we will protect our budgets, as well as take on strategic partnerships to advance our longevity. We look forward to our next chapter. ",
